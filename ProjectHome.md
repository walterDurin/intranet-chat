# IntraNet-Chat #

IntraNet Chat is an open source Intranet messenger style service that runs on java and uses the multicast system to send messages across an Internet.

The main program runs a group chat so that all users can communicate with each other through a graphical user interface.

The program also includes a private chat function that enable two individual users can communicate with each other.

Program facilities include audio warnings, a system tray icon to enable the program to be minimized and a settings function that enables settings from the last session to be recalled.

Give it a try this may be a suitable messaging service for your local network!

If anyone has an idea for a feature that can be added to the program feel free to email it to me and it may get added !
